			<h4>Gauss Elimination (row reduction)</h4>
			<p>
				<strong>Gauss elimination</strong> is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.
				It uses row operations to convert the associated matrix of coeficients into <strong>non-reduced row echelon form</strong> (upper triangular).
				<strong>Gauss-Jordan elimination</strong> uses row operations to convert the matrix is converted into <strong>reduced row echelon form</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A matrix is in row echelon form if it satisfies the following conditions:
				<ul>
					<li>All nonzero rows (rows with at least one nonzero element) are above any rows of all zeroes (all zero rows, if any, belong at the bottom of the matrix).</li>
					<li>The leading coefficient (the first nonzero number from the left, also called the pivot) of a nonzero row is always strictly to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it</li>
					<li>The leading coefficient must be 1.</li>
				</ul>

				A matrix is in reduced row echelon form (also called row canonical form) if it satisfies the following conditions:
				<ul>
					<li>It is in row echelon form.</li>
					<li>Every leading coefficient is 1 and is the only nonzero entry in its column.</li>
				</ul>

				Solve a system of linear equations A*x=b using elimination method steps:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Create the augmented matrix [A | b]<br />
						<img src="../help/CreateAugmentedMatrix.png" />
					</li>
					<li>
						Apply elementary row oprations until augmented matrix is in reduce row echelon form:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Switch two rows<br />
								<img src="../help/SwitchRows.png" />
							</li>
							<li>
								Multiply a srow by a scalar<br />
								<img src="../help/MultiplyRowByAScalar.png" />
							</li>
							<li>
								Add a multiple of a row to a multiple of another row<br />

							</li>
						</ul>
						<em>
							Row index between 1 and total number of rows.<br />
							To divide by a scalar n multiply with the scalar's reciprocal (1/n).
